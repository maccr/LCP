<div id="Q3">

<h4> This is the last question :( </h4>

<p>
	Now we go back and reload previous questions.
</p>
<p>
We use the same method <i>loadQuestion</i> which checks if the question has been previously loaded. if it has it just reshows the DIV otherwise it loads the content.
</p>

<input name="button" type="button" value="ReLoad Question 1" />

<script type="text/javascript">

	// Because we are loading content dynamically we want to avoid any
	// duplicate initialisation of docement.ready events.
	// Therefore rather than use the standard docuement.ready we attach
	// all functions to be ran when the document is loaded to an onPageInit event

	// Execute commands only once when the content has been loaded
	PageManager.onPageInit.subscribe(function () {

	    // Attach a click event to load the next question
		$('#Q3 input[type=button]').unbind().click(function(e){

			// Load the next question
			PageManager.loadQuestion(1);
		});

	});

</script>
